# RiddleGame
A terminal-based Riddle Game built with JavaScript (ES Modules) and Object-Oriented Programming.

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript** (ESM syntax)
- **Node.js**
- **readline-sync** for terminal input

---

## Project Goal

Build a fully synchronous terminal game that:

- Welcomes the player and asks for their name.
- Loads all riddles dynamically from external files.
- Displays riddles one-by-one, waiting for the correct answer.
- Measures how long the player takes to solve all riddles.
- Shows a final report with total and average solving time.

## Riddle Format

Each file in the `riddles/` folder should export a riddle object like so:

```js

export default {
  id: 1,
  name: "Easy Math",
  taskDescription: "What is 5 + 3?",
  correctAnswer: "8"
};
```
